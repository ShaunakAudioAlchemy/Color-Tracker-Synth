# Color-Tracker-Synth
This repository contains a Max patch of a color tracker synth. The areas for Red, Blue and Yellow are detected in the camera input and are passed on to a different sub-patch that triggers multiple synth parameters.

The area values for Red and Green are converted into odd and even harmonics of a signal generator, while that of Blue controls the parameters for stereo panning and granular synthesis.

The patches are included in this repository.
